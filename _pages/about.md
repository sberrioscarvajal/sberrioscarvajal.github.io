## About

I am **Sebastián Berríos**, a Fulbright BIO Fellow and Ph.D. student in **Applied Physics** at Rice University.  
My research centers on **lithium-ion batteries**, where I combine **phase-field**, **P2D**, and **mesoscale** simulations to study **phase separation** and **transport** in advanced cathode materials (e.g., LMFP). I care about bridging rigorous theory with practical energy solutions.

As a first-generation student from **Chile**, I’m committed to the **social role of science**—making technical work accessible, mentoring, and contributing to innovation that benefits society.

## Research Interests

- Phase-field and multiphysics modeling of battery materials  
- P2D models and electrochemical kinetics (Butler–Volmer, thermodynamics-aware OCV)  
- Mesoscale transport in thick electrodes; solid-solution vs. phase-separating behavior  
- Numerical PDE methods and scientific computing

---

## Highlights

- **Mesoscale Materials Science Group (Rice)** — modeling phase separation in LMFP  
- **Operando/​in situ XRD** — analysis workflows for cathode materials  
- **Open science** — reproducible scripts and minimal examples for battery modeling

> I enjoy building transparent, minimal models that clarify mechanisms first, and then scaling them to realistic cells.

## Selected Projects

- **LMFP Phase-Field Model** — Single-particle + P2D coupling to probe intra-particle phase separation.  
- **Operando XRD Toolkit** — Utilities for processing and visualizing diffraction during cycling.  
- **Thick-Electrode Mesoscale Transport** — Comparing kinetics/thermodynamics across regimes.
