## About

I am **Sebastián Berríos**, a Fulbright BIO Fellow and Ph.D. student in **Applied Physics** at Rice University.  
My research centers on **lithium-ion batteries**, where I combine **phase-field**, **P2D**, and **mesoscale** simulations to study **phase separation** and **transport** in advanced cathode materials (e.g., LMFP). I care about bridging rigorous theory with practical energy solutions.

As a first-generation student from **Chile**, I’m committed to the **social role of science**—making technical work accessible, mentoring, and contributing to innovation that benefits society.

## Research Interests

- Phase-field and multiphysics modeling of battery materials.
- P2D models and electrochemical kinetics. 
- Mesoscale transport in thick electrodes; solid-solution vs. phase-separating behavior . 
- Numerical PDE methods and scientific computing.

*Always open to collaborations at the intersection of physics, electrochemistry, and computation.*
