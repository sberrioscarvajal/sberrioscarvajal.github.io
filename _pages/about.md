## About

I am **Sebastián Berríos**, a Fulbright BIO Fellow and Ph.D. student in **Applied Physics** at Rice University. My research centers on **lithium-ion batteries**, where I combine **phase-field**, **P2D**, and **mesoscale** simulations to study **phase separation** and **transport** in advanced cathode materials (e.g., LMFP). I care about bridging rigorous theory with practical energy solutions.

As a first-generation student from **Chile**, I am deeply committed to the **social role of science**. To me, research is not only about advancing knowledge, but also about ensuring that knowledge becomes a tool for collective progress. I believe that scientific work should be accessible beyond academic circles, serving as a bridge between discovery and the challenges faced by communities.

Ultimately, I see my role as a scientist not just in publishing results, but in **helping shape pathways where science empowers people and societies**—whether through open knowledge, collaboration, or applied solutions that meet real human needs.
